## Data Analysis

See my gathering process and discovery [here](https://github.com/sarinac/gustav-holst/blob/main/data/exploratory.ipynb).

**Technical Features:** Spotify provides data on each of the 7 movements. `Duration` is most reliable metric. Because the pieces have dynamic musical phrases like changing tempo or key, the other metrics are not so useful on the track level.

**Analysis:** Spotify's Audio Analysis shows where in the movement gets relatively louder and where different pitches are more prominent. By taking the first `key` on the section level, the third chart reorders the y-axis such that the tonic (a minor in Jupiter) appears on the bottom. Halfway through the piece, a key change to E-flat is shown in the visual.
