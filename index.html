                        <b>The Planets, Op. 32</b> is a seven-movement
                        orchestral suite by the English composer Gustav Holst.
                        The symphony was written between 1914 and 1916 and has
                        been widely performed ever since its premiere in 1918.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Holst was inspired by astrology. Thus, each movement
                        conveys ideas and emotions, ranging from aggression to
                        joy, associated with the astrological characters
                        corresponding to each planet.

                                Mars governs sports and physical competitions.

                                Holst conveys aggression, fear, destruction in
                                Mars. The music makes strong statements that
                                glorify brass, having tubas, trombones, horns,
                                and trumpets carry the melody. The ending
                                unleashes a long and deep fortississimo.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Mars carries a consistent 5-beat march
                                throughout the piece. The majority of this
                                movement is played in 5/4 time.
                            </p>

                                The theme of Mars contains triads moving
                                stepwise. The melody uses dissonance for a
                                chaotic effect and almost never follows mode
                                noted by the key signature and is written with
                                many accidentals.

                                Venus creates a space for life, serenity and
                                beauty after the destruction from Mars. Woodwind
                                and string solos give contrast to the aggressive
                                low brass from the prior movement.

                                Venus enters with a horn solo followed by
                                woodwinds, setting a peaceful and steady
                                atmosphere. This composition alludes to Venus's
                                role of unifying and making peace.

                                He represents communication, mentality,
                                reasoning and adaptability. Mercury governs
                                education, short travels, information and
                                dexterity.

                                Similar to Mercury's swiftness, the third
                                movement is the fastest and shortest in
                                duration. There are a various stepwise melodies,
                                such as scales, thirds or other small jumps.

                                The music is very light and playful. Many of the
                                fast passages are played in staccato or piano.
                                The ending is played very quietly with bells as
                                if the messenger is leaving to his next
                                destination.

                                Jupiter has independent themes that vary in
                                tempo and instrumentation. It invokes warmth and
                                greatness, making Jupiter fit for the title of
                                king.
                            </p>

                                The offbeat rhythm starts the piece to
                                differentiate the structure and flow of Mercury.
                                There are different instrumental features that
                                make Jupiter feel conversational and abundant.

                                There is a warm mellow section in the music in
                                3/4 time that has a grand tune. Holst later used
                                this melody for the British patriotic hymn "I
                                vow to thee my country."

                                As the longest piece, Saturn is mysterious and
                                dynamic. Unlike the previous movements, it
                                changes in mood and style throughout the music.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Saturn starts steadily and quietly. There are
                                several loud points throughout the piece. The
                                middle has a quick crescendo into the loudest
                                peak, creating a sense of chaos followed by
                                another period of stability.
                            </p>

                                Saturn uses tritones in augmented fourths or
                                diminished fifths that give it a sense of
                                hollowness and eeriness, but the piece ends with
                                resolving, full chords.

                            <h1>Uranus: The Magician</h1>
                            <p>♅ Uranus is the personification of the sky.</p>
                            <p>
                                He is associated with ingenuity,
                                unconventionality, individuality, discoveries
                                and democracy. Uranus governs societies and
                                progress.
                            </p>
                        </div>

                        <div class="table-cell">
                            <p>
                                Uranus brings a new liberated feeling after
                                leaving the seriousness atmosphere of Saturn.
                                The style is confident, energetic, and unique.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The composition for Saturn shows originality. It
                                has a very pompous and occassionally impulsive
                                style. Like a sorcerer, the musical ideas seem
                                crafty.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                At the final minute, the music feels like a
                                chant, growing louder and then fading away.
                            </p>

                            <h1>Neptune: The Mystic</h1>
                            <p>♆ Neptune is the god of sea.</p>
                            <p>
                                He is associated with the collective
                                consciousness and vagueness encountered while
                                discovering universal truths. Neptune governs
                                idealism.
                            </p>

                        <div class="table-cell">
                            <p>
                                Neptune's tune is abstract. Instead of themes,
                                there are fragments of melodies and harmonies.
                                The legato playing creates a feeling of the
                                infinite, outer space.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The piece discreetly features a six-part double
                                chorus of wordless women’s voices. The singers
                                are hidden in an adjacent room, and as their
                                voices soften the door is slowly closed,
                                creating silence at the very end.
